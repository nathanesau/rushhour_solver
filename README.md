# rushhour_solver

AI for rush hour. Solves rushhour puzzles using A* algorithm. Implemented in Python.

## Instructions

To run the python solver:

```bash
# python 3.6+
python src/solve.py

# cmake 3.10+
# run after building (should use release variant for cmake)
"D:\rushhour_solver\src\cpp\build\Release\solver.exe" "D:/rushhour_solver/jams"
```

To run the rust solver:

```bash
# build
cargo build --release

# run
"D:/rushhour_solver/src/rust/target/release/rust.exe" --jamdir D:/rushhour_solver/jams
```

## Folder Structure

* jams: Test Cases
* python: A* solver implemented using Python (less than 200 lines)

copying of states should be improved
I don't expect much faster with this algorithm -->

Use WSL with GDB. I have tried other options and this is what worked best for me.

<!-- yes, i am surprised it is slower than the C++ impl too
i guess my rust impl is not written as well as my C++ impl -->
